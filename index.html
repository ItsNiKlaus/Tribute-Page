                <p>Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria (1 December 1949 – 2 December 1993) was a Colombian drug lord and <a

                        class="wiki">narcoterrorist</a> who was
                    the founder and
                    sole
                    leader of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medell%C3%ADn_Cartel" target="_blank"

                    Dubbed
                    "the King of
                    Cocaine,"
                    Escobar is the wealthiest criminal in history, having amassed an estimated net worth of US$30
                    billion by
                    the time of his death—equivalent to $64 billion as of 2021—while his <a

                    trade into the United States in the 1980s and early 1990s. <br><br>

                    Born in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rionegro" target="_blank" class="wiki"> Rionegro</a>
                    and raised in
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medell%C3%ADn" target="_blank" class="wiki"> Medellín</a>,
                    Escobar
                    studied briefly at Universidad Autónoma Latinoamericana
                    of Medellín, but left without graduating; he instead began engaging in criminal activity, selling
                    illegal cigarettes and fake lottery tickets, as well as participating in motor vehicle theft. In the
                    early 1970s, he began to work for various drug smugglers, often kidnapping and holding people for
                    ransom. <br><br>

                    In 1976, Escobar founded the Medellín Cartel, which distributed powder cocaine, and established the
                    first smuggling routes into the United States. Escobar's infiltration into the U.S. created
                    exponential
                    demand for cocaine and by the 1980s it was estimated Escobar led monthly shipments of 70 to 80 tons
                    of
                    cocaine into the country from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia" target="_blank"
                        class="wiki">
                        Colombia</a>. As a
                    result, he quickly became one of the richest people in the
                    world,but constantly battled rival cartels domestically and abroad, leading to massacres and the
                    murders
                    of police officers, judges, locals, and prominent politicians, making Colombia the murder capital of
                    the
                    world. <br><br>

                    In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1982_Colombian_parliamentary_election" target="_blank"
                        class="wiki"> 1982 Colombian
                        parliamentary election</a>, Escobar was elected as an alternate member of the <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamber_of_Representatives_of_Colombia" target="_blank"
                        class="wiki">Chamber
                        of Representatives</a> as part of the Liberal Alternative movement. Through this, he was
                    responsible
                    for
                    community projects such as the construction of houses and football fields, which gained him
                    popularity
                    among the locals of the towns that he frequented. However, Escobar's political ambitions were
                    thwarted
                    by the Colombian and U.S. governments, who routinely <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_Bloc" target="_blank" class="wiki"> pushed for his
                        arrest</a>,
                    with Escobar widely
                    believed
                    to have orchestrated the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAS_Building_bombing"
                        target="_blank" class="wiki">DAS
                        Building</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avianca_Flight_203" target="_blank"
                        class="wiki">Avianca Flight
                        203</a> bombings in retaliation. <br><br>

                    In 1991, Escobar surrendered to authorities, and was sentenced to five years' imprisonment on a host
                    of
                    charges, but struck a deal of no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extradition" target="_blank"
                        class="wiki">
                        extradition</a>
                    with Colombian President <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cesar_Gaviria" target="_blank"
                        class="wiki">
                        Cesar Gaviria</a>,
                    with
                    the ability of
                    being housed in his own, self-built prison, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Catedral"
                        target="_blank" class="wiki">La Catedral</a>. In 1992, Escobar escaped and went into hiding
                    when authorities attempted to move him to a more standard holding facility, leading to a nationwide
                    manhunt. As a result, the Medellín Cartel crumbled, and in 1993, Escobar was killed in his hometown
                    by Colombian National Police, a day after his 44th birthday. <br><br>

                    Escobar's legacy remains controversial; while many denounce the heinous nature of his crimes, he was
                    seen as a "Robin Hood-like" figure for many in Colombia, as he provided many amenities to the poor.
                    His
                    killing was mourned and his funeral attended by over 25,000 people. Additionally, his private
                    estate, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacienda_N%C3%A1poles" target="_blank"
                        class="wiki">Hacienda
                        Nápoles</a>, has been transformed into a theme park. His life has also served as
                    inspiration for or has been dramatized widely in film, television, and in music.
